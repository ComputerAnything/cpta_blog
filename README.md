## 🛠️ Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the `backend` directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **⚙️ Set up the database connection in `config.py`, and configure any environment variables you might need.**

4. **📦 Make initial database migrations:**

    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "initial migration"
    flask db upgrade
    ```

## 🌐 Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the `frontend` directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **🚀 Start the React application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

---

## 🐳 Docker Compose Setup

1. **Build and start all services:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```

2. **Check logs for all services:**

    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f
    ```

3. **Stop all services:**

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

4. **(Optional) Rebuild without cache:**

    ```bash
    docker compose build --no-cache
    ```

- Make sure you have your environment variables set in `backend/.env` and `frontend/.env` before building, use the `.env.example` files as templates.
- The frontend should be built locally (`npm run build`) and the output copied to `backend/frontend/build` if you are not building the frontend inside Docker.
- Run `build_and_copy_frontend.sh` to automate this process.
